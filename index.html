            <h2>MY FIRST WEBSITE APPLICATION</h2>
            <p>
                This is my first web application coded by me Robert Zulu.The things that inspired me to start
                creating website applications it is because I love Technology so much.Robert loves Computers since Grade 10,
                that time Computers they where very expensive but I had one older model.After my Grade 12,I started to 
                learn how to Format the Operating System then I Gained experience in Formating Computers.After gaining experience 
                I had a Passion to study Computer  Science but something went wrong my Father did not have money for that course.
                So I perceived a course at NIPA college in Information Systems and Programming. After starting  college I gained
                experience in solving  problems for any Computer and I was Good with that job.Later I started practicing how to code
                application in Microsoft Visual Studio,then I had a passion in Coding Website Application.
                And this is my first WEBSITE in  Microsoft Visual Studio Website Application and now am here as an experienced front end website developer. 
                 </p>
